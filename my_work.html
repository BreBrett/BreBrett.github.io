                    My interest in web development started in March 2020 when I started thinking about my future, what I want from life and how I can acheieve it, my main goal is to live to enjoy not live to work and have flexaiblity to travel without worrying about bills or using up all of my annual leave! Conincendently SheCodes came to the Pilbara and it felt like fate, so here I am writing code and buiding wesbites!
